You are free to create any issue that enhances the repo by adding support for some standard algorithm. Don't ask me to assign you an issue work on it with proper comments and then create a proper PR.

Create one issue that you want to add and then create a PR that solves one issue at a time.


## Contributing Guidelines

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. 
We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve/add new .cpp codes to this repo. Thank you for helping out and remember,
**no contribution is too small.**

### Some important points to remember:
```
* Use proper title of PR and issue both and title it as the name of complete algo or problem you want to merge 
* Don't copy and code from anywhere I will review every line, it should be your original work and you should understand every line  
* Make sure you compile your code on CPP compiler and it should be error free
* Use proper comments to make code self explanatory 
* The code will be only merged if it satisfies your genuine and devoted effort
```
