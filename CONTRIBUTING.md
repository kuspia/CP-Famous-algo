You are free to create any issue that enhances the repo by adding support for some standard algorithm. Don't ask me to assign you an issue work on it with proper comments and then create a proper PR.

Create one issue that you want to add and then create a PR that solves one issue at a time.

### Some important points to remember:
```
* Use proper title of PR and issue both and title it as the name of complete algo or problem you want to merge 
* Don't copy and code from anywhere I will review every line, it should be your original work and you should understand every line  
* Make sure you compile your code on CPP compiler and it should be error free
* Use proper comments to make code self explanatory 
* The code will be only merged if it satisfies your genuine and devoted effort
```
:) Happy coding

Drop a star if you feel so !!
